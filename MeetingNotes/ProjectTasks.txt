# Questions to address about importing
- What is the image file type? TIFF comes in a variety - what are the dimensions per image?
- Are the dimensions / other settings for the image saving per run constant, or do they vary?
- How is metadata typically stored in the lab?

End goal: TIFF image converted to numpy array
blah blah


1.	Thresholding

# Questions to address
- Do we want users to be able to select thersholding techniques?
- What techniques do you want to be made available?
- User dependendent 

1.1     Otsu's method


End goal: Input array modified to only contain information about selected regions. Output array		



2.	Feature Extraction
2.1.	Entropy Filtering

Input: 1 or more arrays
Process: Use statistics / image analysis codes to search through array and generate summary statistics
Output: Summary statistics. Rows indicate picture ID and columns indicate the summary statistics (features).


3.	PCA

Input: Table from above (features vs picture ID)
Process: PCA or other dimension reduction tool
Output: Eigenvectors (the variation of points/pictures on each vector) and eigenvalues (how much variance is captured in each vector)


4.	Plotting

Input: Eigenvectors and Image metadata
Process: convert to 2D or 3D graphical interface
Output: Graphical interface


5.	BONUS
5.1.	GUI
5.2.	Clicking dots on PCA plot
5.3.	Choosing multiple features
6.	Choice of language
6.1.	Python

Meeting 2 – Notes
We have broken up components of the project. We are going to look further into each of the components to see how we can split tasks in the next meeting.
