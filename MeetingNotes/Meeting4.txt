Meeting #4 - IGP


Goals:
- Get a sample code working where an image can be processed all the way through.
- Within the next couple days. Can talk to each other and stuff

Thresholding:
- What is the goal? Just the stained parts of the cell or the whole cell?
- More images needed to analyse / test for thresholding.


Final project:
- Module for cell profiler?
- Could allow for better access.
- Same scripts as before (python 2 not 3) and allows for easy GUI work.
