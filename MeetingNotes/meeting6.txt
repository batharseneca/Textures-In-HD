# Meeting 6


Things accomplished:
- Tyler made good way in the project proposal. Roles defined.

- wrapper function is defined.


Bilal and Nishanth Notes
- Image thresholding module UI
	- Could be done in Java?
	- Want to have a image / intensity histogram / slider available within CellProfile module parameters page
	- Image updates alongside slider
	- Has option for auto and manual input
	
	
	
Overall Functions
	- All of the functions need to be written out
	- Thresholding (Nishanth talk to Mocle for more images / figuring out bimodal images stuff)
	- Talk to mocle about neighbourhood size
	- Gonna be lax about function writing. Just make sure to update github with changes.
