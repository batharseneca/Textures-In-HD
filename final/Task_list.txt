TESTING ISSUES SO FAR:

- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27784528/numpy-division-with-runtimewarning-invalid-value-encountered-in-double-scalars (line 197 HARALICK!)
    Need to use higher math module?
    NOT RESOLVED
- For Ask Directory button if you press cancel or make no selection : WindowsError: [Error 3] The system cannot find the path specified: ''
    We have to raise an exception or something so that doesn't mess everything up
    !RESOLVED!
- Clicking X on main window by accident would cause loss of current session / no warnings currently --> Overrid the default behavior !RESOLVED!
- Attribute error when loading a saved profile and running without selecting a directory.   !RESOLVED!

        When I tried to do final imageset / 2,5,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90 just texture analysis
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
- POTENTIAL ISSUE :  [Every Run took a minute even when the nhood was 2 or 60..... need to troubleshoot!!!!!!! There are changes in some of the features though.. its weird lol check the texture file for final in results
