- 8 bit Not Working !               ~~~~~~~RESOLVED~~~~~~~~~ PLEASE REVIEW ONCE!

            I tried to convert Laura D Trial 1 files that say they are 16 bit depth.. but they arent failing the 8bit test it returns true - possibly cv2 imread doing this!
            
            Is 16 bit depth different from 16 bit ??? 
            
            Im starting to think when we do opencv imread it is already converting the image so every time we check the dtype it always passes true.
            
            I took the check out and just always convert now to 8 bit. When not converting and just printing from the opencv img its just black losing massssssive data. Any step we were including bitconvert before was losing ALOT of data
            
            Wierd error... when it converts it skips first image (indentation error - RESOLVED)
            
                        Converts perfectly now and images are identical but go from 8mb to like 200 kb!
            
            - Also read this "You should never use astype on an image, because it violates these assumptions about the dtype range"
            http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/user_guide/data_types.html
            
            It is suggesting an alternative to use :
            
            from skimage import img_as_ubyte
        >>> image = np.array([0, 0.5, 1], dtype=float)
        >>> img_as_ubyte(image)       <--- WORKS GREAT TESTED IT - IMPLEMENTED!
            
            
           
        
        
        ~~~~~~~NOT RESOLVED~~~~~~~~~ WE NEED TO DEBUG and make sure it is actually using the numbers for nhood for the desired purpose!?
- POTENTIAL ISSUE :  [Every Run took a minute even when the nhood was 2 or 60..... need to troubleshoot!!!!!!! There are changes in some of the features though.. its weird check the texture file for final in results
Neighborhood Size:  ['2', '5', '10', '20', '30', '40', '50', '60']
bitO:  0
threshO:  0
Time per Run []:

TASK IS DONE!


- Tested Independently added 900 nhood size and it completed in 20s... so its definitly the way the matrix itself is coded not the GUI/sending nhoods to the method or anything like that.. not that its not int etc..






- SIDE NOTE GITHUB MERGING IS SCREWD UP ITS NOT UPLOADING CERTAIN FOLDERS FOR ME NOW .
